# Cows-and-bulls-game
Hi! This is my first ever coding project.
My project is Cows and Bulls Game.
The game is basically a number guessing game.
If you guess a digit correctly which is in the
hidden number but not at the same place you get 1 C
and if it is at the right place too you get 1 B.
Your aim is to get 4 Bs.

The libraries used here are: Random, tkinter
